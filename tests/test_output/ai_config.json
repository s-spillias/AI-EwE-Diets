  "ecosystemDescription": "Shallow warm-water marine environment characterized by extensive coral reefs, diverse fish populations, and significant sea turtle nesting grounds. Features extensive continental shelf areas with depths typically 30-200m, supporting rich benthic communities and important commercial fisheries. Area experiences strong seasonal monsoon influences and hosts critical migration routes for various marine mammals.",
