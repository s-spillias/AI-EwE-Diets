    "Tropical Open Ocean Zooplankton": "This group includes both key zooplankton species and broader functional groups, such as mesozooplankton, microzooplankton, and pelagic bacteria, found in the tropical open ocean habitat. They play a crucial role in marine food webs as primary and secondary consumers, and contribute to nutrient cycling through the microbial loop."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Coastal and Island Zooplankton": "This group consists of zooplankton species and functional groups, including nearshore and smaller seabirds, that inhabit coastal and island waters. They serve as important food sources for many marine predators and link marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Pelagic Fish": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of fish found in the tropical pelagic habitat, such as planktivores, flying fish, remoras, large toothed whales and dolphins, tuna and billfish, reef sharks, pelagic sharks, and demersal sharks. These species occupy various trophic levels and contribute to energy transfer within the marine food web."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Coastal and Island Fish": "This group consists of fish species and functional groups that inhabit tropical coastal and island waters, including nearshore and smaller seabirds, reef sharks, skates and rays, and crocodiles. These species play important ecological roles in their respective habitats and contribute to benthic-pelagic coupling."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Demersal Fish": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of demersal fish found in tropical waters, such as herbivorous demersal fish, benthic filter feeders, benthic infaunal carnivores, and large carnivorous zooplankton. They occupy various trophic levels and contribute to benthic food webs and nutrient cycling."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Deep-Water Fish": "This group consists of fish species and functional groups that inhabit deeper tropical waters, including slope/deep water benthivores, slope/deep demersal omnivorous fish, slope/deep medium demersal piscivores, slope/deep large piscivores, and migratory mesopelagic fish. These species play important roles in deep-water food webs and energy transfer between depths."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Cephalopods": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of cephalopods found in tropical waters, such as squid and octopus. They are important predators in many marine ecosystems and contribute to energy transfer and nutrient cycling."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Coral Reefs": "This group consists of hard corals, soft corals, sea anemones, and zooxanthellae that form coral reef ecosystems. They create complex habitat structure, support biodiversity, and contribute to nutrient cycling through symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Seagrass, Mangroves, and Salt Marshes": "This group includes seagrass, mangroves, and salt marsh plants that form important coastal habitats. They provide nursery areas, protect shorelines, and contribute to nutrient cycling."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Macroalgae and Microalgae": "This group consists of macroalgae, microalgae, and ice-associated algae that provide habitat and food for many species in tropical waters. They contribute to primary production and nutrient cycling."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Benthic Invertebrates": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of benthic invertebrates, such as macrozoobenthos, meiobenthos, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, crown-of-thorns starfish, and benthic grazers. They play important roles in benthic food webs, nutrient cycling, and sediment processing."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Hydrothermal Vent and Cold Seep Communities": "This group consists of specialized organisms living around deep-sea vents and cold seeps, including chemosynthetic bacteria and associated fauna. They form unique ecosystems adapted to extreme environments."
  },
  {
    "Tropical Discards and Detritus": "This group includes discards from fisheries activities and detritus, which serve as important food sources for many scavengers and decomposers in the marine ecosystem."
