        "Tropical Open Ocean Zooplankton": "This group includes both key zooplankton species and broader functional groups, such as mesozooplankton, microzooplankton, and pelagic bacteria, found in the tropical open ocean habitat. They play a crucial role in marine food webs as primary and secondary consumers, and contribute to nutrient cycling through the microbial loop.",
        "Tropical Coastal and Island Zooplankton": "This group consists of zooplankton species and functional groups, including nearshore and smaller seabirds, that inhabit coastal and island waters. They serve as important food sources for many marine predators and link marine and terrestrial ecosystems.",
        "Tropical Pelagic Fish": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of fish found in the tropical pelagic habitat, such as planktivores, flying fish, remoras, large toothed whales and dolphins, tuna and billfish, reef sharks, pelagic sharks, and demersal sharks. These species occupy various trophic levels and contribute to energy transfer within the marine food web.",
        "Tropical Coastal and Island Fish": "This group consists of fish species and functional groups that inhabit tropical coastal and island waters, including nearshore and smaller seabirds, reef sharks, skates and rays, and crocodiles. These species play important ecological roles in their respective habitats and contribute to benthic-pelagic coupling.",
        "Tropical Demersal Fish": "This group includes both key species and functional groups of demersal fish found in tropical waters, such as herbivorous demersal fish, benthic filter feeders, benthic infaunal carnivores, and large carnivorous zooplankton. They occupy various trophic levels and contribute to benthic food webs and nutrient cycling.",
