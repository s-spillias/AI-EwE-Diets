\suppsection{Data Harvesting Implementation}\label{supp:data_harvesting}

Our data harvesting system employs DuckDB for efficient querying of PARQUET files, enabling complex joins and aggregations without full memory loading. For species matching across databases, we use structured SQL queries that join on concatenated genus and species names:

\begin{verbatim}
SELECT * FROM sealifebase_df
WHERE SpecCode = {spec_code}
AND PreyStage LIKE '%adult%'
AND PredatorStage LIKE '%adult%'
\end{verbatim}

When combining interaction data from GLOBI with diet information, we implement a comprehensive interaction mapping system that creates bidirectional records:

\begin{verbatim}
interaction_data[source_group]['preys_on'][target_group] = count
interaction_data[target_group]['is_preyed_on_by'][source_group] = count
\end{verbatim}

Our data cleaning protocol standardises types by converting numerical values to consistent formats and timestamps to ISO format. We handle null values by removing empty values, `NA' strings, and null entries while preserving data structure. Source tracking maintains database origin information for all data points.

The system implements file locking mechanisms for concurrent access, with separate locks for species data and interaction networks. We use exponential backoff retry logic for API interactions, with configurable parameters including maximum retries (5), initial delay (1 second), and maximum delay (60 seconds).

The completion check system verifies the presence of required fields including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete taxonomic hierarchy
\item Species-specific database records (when available)
\item Interaction data
\item Source attribution
\item Data quality indicators
\end{itemize}

The final JSON output maintains a consistent structure across all species entries, facilitating automated processing in subsequent framework stages.

      \caption{Detailed diet matrix consistency across five iterations for each geographic region. Column names represent predator groups and row names represent their prey groups. Numbers in each cell indicate the mean diet proportions across five iterations, while cell colors indicate the stability score (0-1, where 0 represents perfect stability and 1 represents maximum variation). White cells represent absent feeding relationships. This comprehensive visualization complements the stability score distributions and predator-specific analyses presented in the main text (Figures 4 and 5).}

Panel (b) displays the absolute differences in diet proportions between expert and AI matrices where interactions are present in both, with colors ranging from purple (small differences) to yellow (large differences). Panel (c) shows the proportional breakdown of interaction types for each predator group, while panel (d) presents the frequency distribution of absolute differences in diet proportions.

    \caption{Heatmap showing the stability of functional group classifications across regions. Each cell displays the Jaccard similarity score (ranging from 0.975 to 1.000) between consecutive framework iterations, where 1.000 indicates perfect consistency in species assignments. Darker red colors represent higher stability (scores near 1.000), while lighter colors indicate more variable classifications (scores closer to 0.975). Most functional groups show high stability (>0.99) across all regions, with occasional variations in groups like benthic grazers and deposit feeders, particularly in the Northern Territory region.}

  \suppsubsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation Implementation}\label{supp:rag_implementation}
  
  We implement a retrieval-augmented generation system using ChromaDB for vector storage and document management. Document processing begins with LlamaParse conversion of source materials to markdown format, preserving structural elements while enabling consistent text extraction across document types. We segment documents using a token-aware chunking strategy with a 2000-token maximum size, determined through empirical testing to balance context preservation with model limitations.
  
  Document processing follows a two-phase approach. The initial phase generates embeddings for each document chunk using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, storing them in ChromaDB's PersistentClient. The system maintains an indexed\_files.json registry to track processed documents. The second phase handles incremental updates, identifying and processing only new content when documents are added to the source directory.
  
  For diet composition analysis, we implement a two-stage query process. The first stage employs a simple query to retrieve relevant document chunks:
  
  \begin{prompt}
  What do [group] eat?
  \end{prompt}
  
  The system embeds this query using the same Azure OpenAI model and performs vector similarity search to identify relevant document chunks. These results combine with structured data sources including species occurrence frequencies, food category classifications, and GLOBI interaction data to form a comprehensive input for the second stage.
  
  We implement comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline. The system employs exponential backoff retry logic for API interactions, with configurable parameters including maximum retries (10), initial delay (1 second), and maximum delay (300 seconds). For model interactions, we utilise LlamaIndex's query engine with zero-temperature sampling to ensure deterministic responses. The system supports multiple language model backends including Claude-3 Sonnet (200k token context), GPT-4, and AWS Claude, enabling flexible deployment based on availability and performance requirements.
  
  The system maintains separate storage contexts for different document collections through ChromaDB's collection management. This separation prevents cross-contamination between knowledge bases while enabling efficient parallel processing. We track document citations throughout the retrieval process, maintaining provenance information for all retrieved content. The complete implementation, including embedding generation, chunking algorithms, and query processing functions, is available in the project repository.
