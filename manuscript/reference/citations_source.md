From Global overview of the applications of the Ecopath with Ecosim modeling approach using the EcoBase models repository

The Life Sciences have reached a new era, that of the ‘Big New Biology’ (Thessen and Patterson, 2011). Ecology is following a similar path, and has turned into a ‘data-intensive science’ (Kelling et al., 2009, Michener and Jones, 2012). Ecological studies are more and more based on data-driven methodologies, relying on large pre-existing datasets and allowing for new insights on complex or underlying phenomena at global scale (e.g., Christensen et al., 2009b). A popular example of open-access, digital and cross-disciplinary database in aquatic ecology is FishBase, the online encyclopedia of fishes (www.fishbase.org
). However, extensive data sharing is still rare in Life Sciences, and ecology has not yet joined the other historical “big” sciences, such as oceanography, meteorology or astronomy, where massive data-sharing is the norm (Pauly, 1995, Edwards, 2010, Hampton et al., 2013). Although incentives for digitization of non-digital materials have been growing, existing repositories, such as FishBase, were estimated to represent less than 1% of the data in ecology (Reichman et al., 2011, Thessen and Patterson, 2011).
Data sharing is a required principle for independent verification and reuse (Vision, 2010), and published papers which make their data available are cited more frequently (Piwowar et al., 2007). Yet, the open-access principle of sharing information online for free has been increasingly applied to publications, but much less to data, mainly due to issues with recognition and sense of data ownership (Vision, 2010, Thessen and Patterson, 2011). Data sharing is not a tradition in ecology and faces multiple sociological and technological obstacles. Overall, new practices are needed to make data sharing fully part of the culture in Life Sciences (Pauly, 1988, Reichman et al., 2011, Thessen and Patterson, 2011, Dalgleish et al., 2012, Hampton et al., 2013). The two critical stages at which practices have to be improved to allow for data sharing are the very first, i.e., the collection of the data, and the very last, i.e., their publication. Most of the time, biological data are not being collected with reuse in mind and are then published in a narrative or summarized style in scientific articles (Vision, 2010, Thessen and Patterson, 2011). The actual data are meant to be provided in online supplements or upon individual requests sent to the authors, but these options often remain unreliable (Vision, 2010). Also, extensive data sharing may solve – at least in part – the problem of data loss, such as hard-copies or computer files in outmoded format (Zeller et al., 2005).
While facing the challenges of open data, ecology is more and more relying on modeling-based approaches to inform management. In aquatic ecology, the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling approach has been widely applied to inform ecosystem-based management (e.g., Jarre-Teichmann, 1998, Plagányi and Butterworth, 2004, Christensen and Walters, 2011, Coll and Libralato, 2012), since its original development in the early 1980s (Polovina, 1984). EwE is commonly described as an ecosystem model, and more precisely corresponds to a quantitative, process-based and species-based model, representing trophic flows in the ecosystem. The EwE modeling approach was primarily developed as a tool-box to help fisheries management and answer ‘what if’ questions about policy that could not be addressed with single-species assessment models (Pauly et al., 2000, Christensen and Walters, 2004, Christensen and Walters, 2011). Details on the core principles and equations of EwE can be found in the EwE user guide available online (Christensen et al., 2008). The EwE software is user-friendly, free (under the terms of the GNU General Public License) and downloadable online (www.ecopath.org
). Thus, hundreds of EwE models representing aquatic (but also some terrestrial) ecosystems have been developed and published worldwide.
Building an EwE model require the collection, compilation and harmonization of various types of information: descriptive data on species abundance, diet composition and catch; computed data on species production, consumption and ecosystem properties; and simulation data on species biomass trends, after applying alternate scenarios (Christensen et al., 2008). By summarizing all available knowledge on the modeled ecosystems and deriving various system properties, EwE models help understanding the structure and functioning of ecosystems (Walters et al., 1997). Thus, EwE-based studies may be seen as important sources of information. On top of detailed information on the modeled species and food web, each EwE-based study also provides a general description of the modeled ecosystem, which represents critical information to reuse the model for performing meta-analyses. Several meta-analyses have been performed based on a selection of EwE models, and focusing, either on ecological and trophic concepts (e.g., Christensen and Pauly, 1993a, Gascuel et al., 2008, Arreguín-Sánchez, 2011), or on ecosystems and species of particular interest (e.g., Christensen, 1995, Christensen et al., 2003a, Christensen et al., 2003b, Pauly et al., 2009). However, only few meta-analyses have been using large collections (more than 50) of EwE models (e.g., Coll et al., 2012, Pikitch et al., 2012, Heymans et al., 2014). These meta-analyses were based on individual datasets since no comprehensive, open-access, and digital collection of EwE models was available, and this is why EcoBase was created. EcoBase is an online information repository of EwE models published worldwide in the scientific literature (see website at http://sirs.agrocampus-ouest.fr/EcoBase/
).
In this study, we used EcoBase to compile available metadata on all the EwE models referenced in the repository. We analyzed the metadata to give a global overview of the applications of the EwE modeling approach in the scientific literature. We focused on some critical aspects: the general characteristics of the modeled ecosystems, the objectives of the EwE-based studies, the complexity and scope of the models, and the associated publication(s). First, we proposed a general description of the EwE applications published worldwide. Then, based on the year of publication of the models, we analyzed in detail the evolution of the EwE applications over the last three decades. Last, we performed a correspondence analysis on the metadata so as to formalize the relationships observed between some of the critical metadata and identify the main types of EwE models. We concluded with a discussion on the challenges and potentials of compiling metadata from EwE models and conducting meta-analyses, notably by using EcoBase. We intended to provide new insights on past, present and future usages of and interests for the EwE modeling approach in the scientific community.

A central tenet of ecosystem management is identifying trade-offs among multiple ecosystem goods and services and the attendant consequences of those trade-offs for biological, economic, and social objectives (Fogarty, 2014; Hilborn, 2011; Larkin, 1996; Link, 2010a; Link & Marshak, 2019; McLeod & Leslie, 2009; Pikitch et al., 2004). Failure to consider trade-offs can lead to unintended management outcomes, unrealistic expectations among stakeholders, and further degradation of marine ecosystems (Andersen et al., 2015; Holsman et al., 2020; Karnauskas et al., 2021; Siple et al., 2019). A broader consideration of the interactions among ecological dynamics, socio-economic factors, and governance systems is needed to facilitate more effective resource management and decision-making (Arkema et al., 2006; Dickey-Collas, 2014; Harvey et al., 2017; Levin et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2018; Stephenson et al., 2017). In response to these concerns, an ecosystem approach to marine resource management is a stated goal of many nations (U.S. Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Road Map, NOAA, 2016; European Union (EU) Common Fisheries Policy, Jennings & Rice, 2011; EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Ramírez-Monsalve et al., 2016; Australia's Ocean Policy, Vince et al., 2015; Canadian Oceans Act, Jessen, 2011), with articulated principles and best practices for developing ecosystem approaches now codified by many intergovernmental organizations (FAO, Garcia et al., 2003; IUCN, Rodríguez et al., 2015; UNEP, Ferreira et al., 2022; ICES, Ballesteros et al., 2018; PICES, Kim et al., 2014).

Ecosystem approaches vary along a continuum from single species management with ecosystem considerations to holistic, ecosystem-based management (Dolan et al., 2016; Link & Browman, 2014). On one end of the spectrum, single species fisheries management is focused on single stocks with no explicit ecosystem considerations, though ecosystem processes often can be implicitly incorporated (Burgess et al., 2017; Methot, 2009; Plagányi & Butterworth, 2004). The ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) maintains a focus on single stocks but includes explicit consideration of one or more ecosystem processes, such as oceanographic effects on recruitment (Tolimieri et al., 2018) and predator effects on natural mortality (Dorn & Barnes, 2022; see also Marshall et al., 2019). Similar to EAF, ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) focuses solely on fisheries, but considers the entirety of the natural resource system (e.g., multiple target and bycatch species and their predators and prey), including multispecies interactions and environmental drivers that influence the broader community or ecosystem (Hollowed et al., 2000; Karp et al., 2023; Link, 2018; Plagányi et al., 2014). Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a holistic approach that extends beyond fisheries to include the objectives and trade-offs associated with multiple ocean use sectors (e.g., petroleum extraction, aquaculture, renewable energy; Arkema et al., 2006; Ruckelshaus et al., 2008; Long et al., 2015). The common underlying principle of these approaches is that effective resource management increasingly requires consideration of a more comprehensive range of biological, socio-economic, and institutional factors related to human use of the ocean.

The practical implementation of ecosystem approaches to management almost always requires some form of ecosystem modelling within the context of a natural resource management process (Collie et al., 2016; Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2012; Fulton et al., 2011; Hollowed et al., 2011; Lehuta et al., 2016; Pascoe et al., 2017; Plagányi et al., 2014; Townsend et al., 2019). Decision-makers rely on the outputs from models to (1) understand the past, current, and potential future state of living marine resources, (2) evaluate the likely outcome of alternative policy options, (3) explore trade-offs that arise from ecological processes, management interventions, or among stakeholders, and (4) develop strategic and tactical resource management advice. Ecosystem models include a range of qualitative and quantitative representations of all or selected parts of an ecosystem and typically include effects such as environmental variability, species interactions, and socio-economic factors.

We refer to models that are used to support and inform resource management as ‘operational models’. Operational models are characterized by (1) use of established methodological approaches and best practices during model development, (2) regular use of the model to provide information in support of a resource management process, (3) use of the most recently available data that has been quality-controlled, archived, and is easily accessible, (4) model outputs that can inform actionable choices from a defined set of alternatives, and (5) ideally, evaluation of trade-offs among ecological, socio-economic, and policy objectives. Operational models are also regularly updated using established procedures and their outputs are familiar to decision-makers. For example, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) develops ‘key runs’ using reviewed EwE models that are routinely updated and used to inform ecosystem status, stock status, and resource allocation decisions (ICES, 2019).

Ecosystem models can be used to provide both strategic and tactical management advice as well as provide the context within which management decisions are considered. Strategic and tactical applications are two different but related aspects of the operational use of ecosystem models (Collie et al., 2016; Gavaris, 2009; Plagányi et al., 2014). Strategic model applications are related to decisions about what will or can be done to achieve specific goals and objectives, while tactical model applications are related to how the specific strategy will be implemented, usually via short-term decisions that can be adjusted on a regular basis (Gavaris, 2009). Strategic applications are typically focused on relatively long time scales (e.g., 5–20 years) while tactical applications are focused on relatively short time scales (e.g., 1–5 years). For example, a strategic decision has been made in many jurisdictions to maintain fishing mortality at levels that will support the long-term maximum sustainable yield (MSY) from a stock, while a tactical decision is the short-term adjustments to catch limits needed to maintain this fishing mortality rate. While the use of ecosystem models in an operational resource management context is increasing, they have generally played a limited role in the decision-making process for most fisheries and ecosystems (Cowan et al., 2012; Karp et al., 2023; Skern-Mauritzen et al., 2016).

Ecosystem models that focus on food webs attempt to understand how trophic interactions affect the flow of matter and energy among different species and functional groups in aquatic ecosystems (Belgrano et al., 2005). Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) is the most widely used food web modelling approach in marine ecosystems (Christensen & Walters, 2004; Colléter et al., 2015; Pauly et al., 2000; Polovina, 1984; Steenbeek et al., 2016; Walters et al., 1997). Ecospace is a spatial representation of EwE that allows for the movement of represented groups (Steenbeek et al., 2021; Walters et al., 1999). EwE explicitly incorporates trophic interactions among multiple species and functional groups, while the broader food web is simultaneously constrained by the conservation of mass. As a result, EwE can be used to evaluate the effects of bottom-up (Piroddi et al., 2021), top-down (Christensen & Pauly, 2004), and middle-out (Lamb et al., 2019) processes on various components of the ecosystem. These characteristics make EwE particularly useful for quantifying trade-offs that arise from natural or anthropogenic perturbations or management interventions, disentangling direct and indirect effects that are mediated through food web interactions, and assessing the cumulative impacts of multiple anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems (Christensen & Pauly, 2004; Coll et al., 2015; Villasante et al., 2016). As such, EwE models can help decision-makers understand the range of possible ecosystem responses and trade-offs that can occur due to human activities. EwE also has a large and collaborative user community with hundreds of models constructed to address an increasing array of issues (Colléter et al., 2013, 2015), multiple symposia and syntheses to document and evaluate technical advances and model uses (Christensen & Pauly, 2004; Coll et al., 2015; Villasante et al., 2016), free and easily accessible software with tested applications, modular subroutines, technical support (www.ecopath.org), and diagnostic and best practices protocols (Ainsworth & Walters, 2015; Heymans et al., 2016; Lassalle et al., 2014; Link, 2010b; Steenbeek et al., 2018). Hence, EwE is well-positioned for operational use in fisheries and in natural resource management in general.

In this paper, we review selected case studies where an Ecopath, Ecosim, or Ecospace (hereafter ‘EwE’) model has been developed within an operational context to inform fisheries or multi-sector resource management. Prior reviews of EwE models have focused on use of the model over decadal time scales (Colléter et al., 2015), applications in ecosystems of particular interest (Coll & Libralato, 2012; Woodstock & Zhang, 2022), technical aspects of the model (Plagányi & Butterworth, 2004), applications to particular species groups (e.g., predatory fishes, Christensen et al., 2003; jellyfishes, Lamb et al., 2019; forage fishes, Pikitch et al., 2014), and the development of management-relevant outputs (Heymans et al., 2014). The advantages and limitations of EwE as an operational tool to support fisheries and multi-sector resource management have rarely been considered. Our premise is that developing a functional model is only one step required for operational use, and so we emphasize issues beyond the technical aspects of model development, testing, and validation (Plagányi & Butterworth, 2004). While we focus on EwE models because the platform has many characteristics amenable to operational use, our conclusions are relevant to other types of ecosystem models as well. Our primary assertion is that the requisite conditions for enhanced operational use of EwE and other ecosystem models exists, and we recommend explicit criteria to facilitate the use of these models to support fisheries and natural resource management.

Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has been adopted as a policy goal for50
ocean management agencies worldwide (FAO 2003; European Commission 2013; NOAA 2016),51
and ecosystem models are an essential tool for evaluating tradeoffs among alternative52
management scenarios within EBFM. There are many types of ecosystem models (Hollowed et53
al. 2000; Plagányi 2007; O’Farrell et al. 2017), but one common strategy involves modelling54
consumption rates to predict changes in natural mortality and/or individual growth rates for55
modeled functional groups. In particular, mass-balance models track the flow of biomass among56
producers, consumers, predators, and fisheries (among other potential variables). The mass-57
balance model Ecopath (Polovina 1984) is a foundational example of mass-balance models, and58
it represents ecosystem structure by tracking flows between biomass pools given input59
parameters for initial biomass, production/biomass ratio, consumption/biomass ratio, diet60
composition, and fishery removals for each biomass pool. Input parameters are estimated outside61
the modeling framework and entered as known values using information from fishery62
independent surveys, fishery dependent sampling, and literature review. Because parameters63
come from a variety of disparate sources, it is often necessary to further tune input parameters to64
achieve conditions where no group has more removals (consumption and fishing) than65
production (i.e., “balance the model”). Guidelines are widely available for defining consumption66
per biomass (Palomares and Pauly 1998), production per biomass (Allen 1971), and for assessing67
the plausibility of a proposed Ecopath model (Link 2010). Ecopath can then be used to quantify68
ecosystem stability, optimum fisheries yield, and other metrics of ecosystem structure69
(Christensen and Walters 2004).70
5
Mass-balance models were subsequently extended to projected dynamics forward in time71
given observed fishing rates or under hypothetical management scenarios. In particular, Ecosim72
(Walters et al. 1997; Pauly et al. 2000) recast Ecopath as a set of differential equations, and the73
resulting Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software remains one of the most widely-used ecosystem74
modelling platforms in the world (Colléter et al. 2015). The Ecopath mass balance is used to75
initialize the deterministic dynamic model Ecosim by deriving growth efficiency (initial ratio of76
production to consumption) and unobserved mortality parameters (initial production times the77
fraction of production not consumed by predators or removed by fishing). To promote78
ecosystem stability, Ecosim incorporates a functional response based on “foraging arena theory”79
(Walters et al. 1997), where predators can only forage upon an accessible fraction of prey as80
determined by vulnerability parameters (Ahrens et al. 2012). Ecosim projections therefore81
depend upon (and are sensitive to) both the input Ecopath mass-balance parameters and the82
vulnerability parameters governing the functional response (Gaichas et al. 2012). Ecosim83
vulnerability parameters are sometimes tuned via fit to predator-prey time-series (Scott et al.84
2016; Bentley et al. 2024). However, time-series predictions of biomass are only calculated85
when tuning Ecosim, so this two-stage approach precludes using time-series data to tune the86
mass-balance parameters in Ecopath.87
Ecopath-with-Ecosim (EwE) has been used to explore potential ecosystem thresholds88
(Gaichas et al. 2012), compare the performance of alternative management strategies89
(Christensen and Walters 2004; Lucey et al. 2021), and evaluate single-species reference points90
(Walters et al. 2005), among many other examples. EwE has seen less use to set annual fisheries91
management policies (e.g., harvest limits), although examples exist for using it to modify92
6
existing single-species reference points to account for species interactions (Chagaris et al. 2020;93
Howell et al. 2021).94
To complement “strategic advice” provided by ecosystem models such as EwE, there is95
also increased effort to estimate time-varying parameters within single-species stock assessments96
(Nielsen and Berg 2014). This generally involves state-space estimation (de Valpine 2002),97
which involves estimating both measurement errors (e.g., the difference between predicted and98
observed biomass) and process errors (e.g., variation in demographic rates). Stock assessments99
worldwide increasingly use state-space modelling (Stock and Miller 2021), and it is viewed as an100
essential feature for future assessment-model development (Punt et al. 2020). This increased use101
arises in part because state-space models can mitigate the bias that otherwise results from102
treating some time-varying process as if it was stationary in time (Xu et al. 2020; Stock et al.103
2021). State-space models require estimating the variance of random effects simultaneously104
with other parameters, and therefore also requires jointly calculating the likelihood of data given105
fixed and random effects as well as the probability of random effects given any hyperparameters106
(Thorson and Minto 2015).107
Statistical multispecies models (a.k.a. multispecies statistical catch-at-age) provide an108
alternative to whole-of-ecosystem models (e.g., EwE) and state-space population models for109
modelling populationand community dynamics. For example, CEATTLE (Jurado-Molina et al.110
2005; Holsman et al. 2016) and GADGET (Begley and Howell 2004) both fit to survey and111
fisheries data for multiple interacting species, while tracking how predation affects natural112
mortality for those modeled prey species. These models serve as a useful middle-ground113
between whole-of-ecosystem and single-species stock assessment models; they provide more114
statistical rigor than EwE by using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods to fit to time-series115
7
data (with associated asymptotics and confidence-interval performance), while still tracking top-116
down (predatory) control of prey species by tracking consumptive interactions. However,117
statistical multispecies models typically do not model the impact of prey availability on predator118
growth or survival (termed “bottom-up control”), and therefore cannot account for how changes119
in forage availability may affect the productivity of commercially important consumers.120
In this study, we introduce the first (to our knowledge) example of fitting a state-space121
mass-balance ecosystem model to time-series data, including abundance indices and fishery122
catches. To do so, we adapt the dynamics specified by Ecopath and Ecosim but use RTMB123
(Kristensen 2024b) to implement automatic differentiation and fit process errors via maximum124
marginal likelihood. We estimate equilibrium population biomass, nonequilibrium initial125
conditions, catchability coefficients, the variance of process errors via fit to available time-series,126
as well as other potential parameters (e.g., predator-prey vulnerability). We distribute our code127
as an R package EcoState, initially available on GitHub (https://github.com/James-Thorson-128
NOAA/EcoState) with full function documentation and user vignettes, and intended for129
distribution via CRAN upon full release. We use real-world data from the eastern Bering Sea to130
develop a “minimal realistic model” including 10 functional groups and one detrital pool (11131
variables) centered on prey, competitors, and predators for Alaska pollock (Gadus132
chalcogrammus). This case-study suggests that fluctuations in krill are associated with cycles of133
lower or higher productivity for pollock. We also use a simulation experiment involving pelagic134
primary producer, demersal detritus, two consumers, and two predators to confirm that we can135
recover true parameters with reasonable statistical accuracy and precision. Finally, we conclude136
by discussing directions for future developments of state-space whole-of-ecosystem models, and137
how these models compare with state-space surplus production models.

Mass balance models describe the structure and flow of energy through the system. They are commonly used for quantifying food web interactions in a “whole-ecosystem” context. The most popular of these models is Ecopath which was first developed by Polovina (1984) to explain the net primary production required to support a tropical reef system. That model has been modified and expanded to fit all types of aquatic and even terrestrial ecosystems (Fretzer, 2014). Part of its power is that it makes use of input quantities that are regularly measured in single-species resource management, such as biomass, mortality rates, and growth rates, that are then placed into the mass-balance framework to determine ecosystem “unknowns” such as lower trophic-level productivity.
Ecosim (Walters et al., 1997) uses Ecopath models as a basis for parameterizing a set of biomass-dynamics differential equations that include functional responses between predators and prey, removals by humans (hereafter “fishing”), and environmental drivers that may be time-varying. Ecosim is used to conduct dynamic simulations, either to explain historical changes in ecosystem structure and function, or to predict the direct and indirect effects of both human-driven and natural ecosystem perturbations. A later iteration of the Ecosim equations (Walters et al., 2000) added a method for modeling age-specific life stages (hereafter “stanzas”) for individual species using delay-difference equations in conjunction with the biomass dynamics model, to explicitly model recruitment, variable growth, ontogenetic diet shifts, and age-based fisheries selectivity. Ecopath and Ecosim are used together in an ecosystem-based management context, to identify and quantify major energy flows in the system, describe ecosystem resources and their interactions, evaluate the ecosystem effects of fishing or environmental changes, and exploring management policy options (Plaganyi, 2007).
A large measure of these tools’ popularity comes from the development of a user-friendly package, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE; Christensen, Pauly, 1992, Steenbeek, Buszowski, Christensen, Akoglu, Aydin, Ellis, Felinto, Guitton, Lucey, Kearney, Mackinson, Pan, Platts, Walters, 2015). EwE has many strengths including ease of use through a convenient graphical user interface (GUI) and the ability to track data quality as an inherent part of EwE data entry. Further, the EwE package includes a wide range of add-on tools for calculating ecosystem properties such as cycling, diversity, and throughput. Users can input their parameters directly into a spreadsheet or import them from a comma delimitated file. Modifications can be made within the GUI for running simulations. However, this strength is also a weakness. Users must take extreme caution to insure that user error is not introduced as running multiple simulations requires users to record the settings for each run. It is possible that some modifications may not be saved and therefore limit the reproducibility by other users.
EwE software is open source and freely available at www.ecopath.org
. Open source means that there is universal access to the code and that the code can be redistributed or subsequently improved by any interested users (Steenbeek et al., 2015). This allows users to overcome some GUI-specific issues such as running scripts directly from the base code. The base code is built on the Microsoft.NET platform, primarily using Visual Basic.
Many ecologists are familiar with the rapidly growing statistical language R (Tippmann, 2014). It is the software of choice for many scientists who are transitioning from costly, platform-specific commercial software packages. A recent search on Elsevier’s Scopus database showed that one in 100 scholarly articles cite R or one of its packages, with even greater citation rates in the agricultural and environmental sciences (Tippmann, 2014). R is available for multiple operating systems and has a rich user community with strong on-line support. R was the 12th most popular programming language on GitHub, a popular version control repository, including the most new collaborations per repository which demonstrates that it is being actively used and modified (Smith, 2015). R also boasts a publication quality graphical engine that allows users to generate figures in the same programming environment that they conducted their statistical analyses.
Here we introduce an R implementation of Ecopath and Ecosim called Rpath, which is meant to be a complement to the existing EwE software. Our goals were to develop a flexible tool that would take advantage of the built-in graphical and statistical prowess of R and allow for better reproducibility of ecosystem modeling by capturing all changes in a script format meaning analyses can be easily recreated by others. Furthermore, recoding of Ecopath and Ecosim using R’s extensive libraries for linear algebra and matrix manipulation allows for greater readability of the underlying code and greater extensibility by the community of researchers familiar with R.
Rpath includes the mass-balance methods of Polovina (1984), the biomass dynamics methods (Walters et al., 1997) and the life history stanzas methods (Walters et al., 2000). The mass-balance algorithms are implemented using R’s linear algebra library. The core dynamic simulation derivative and numerical integration routines are implemented using C++ code based on Aydin et al. (2007) re-written using the Rcpp library (Eddelbuettel and Francois, 2011) to make use of R’s vector operations and transparent coding structure within the C++ code, while allowing the parameter setup and results analysis to be performed seamlessly in the R environment (the Rsim family of functions within the Rpath package).
This paper is not meant to serve as a user’s manual for Rpath but rather to describe the mass balance and dynamic simulation algorithms that are implemented in the base library of Rpath. The R package, which can be downloaded at https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath
, includes several vignettes that demonstrate how to run the model.

Ecopath with Ecosim (hereinafter EwE) is a freely available ecosystem-modelling complex for analysis of anthropogenically exploited aquatic ecosystems. EwE affords a quantitative and species-based representation of any aquatic system of interest, enabling construction and analysis of food-web models through a suite of ecosystem-level simulations (Christensen and Walters, 2004). The Ecopath approach was advanced originally by Polovina (1984a, b) to estimate the biomass of distinct components, i.e. species or groups of species, of the French Frigate Shoals system, in the north-western Hawaiian Islands (Heymans et al., 2016). Ecopath was integrated thereafter with diverse approaches in theoretical ecology, in particular those advanced by Ulanowicz (1986), regarding analysis of flows amidst separate components of a given ecosystem. The Ecopath system has undergone extensive development since 1990 (Christensen and Pauly, 1992), culminating ultimately in the integrated software package ‘Ecopath with Ecosim’ (Christensen and Walters, 2004).
The Ecopath approach has long been utilised within the field of marine science, from analysis of fisheries management, aquaculture, and general marine ecology, to assessments of climate change, pollution, and offshore platform impacts (Piroddi et al., 2011; Niiranen et al., 2013; Colléter et al., 2015; Serpetti et al., 2017). In the context of fisheries, for example, EwE allows scientists to (i) envision alterations in exploited fish communities, as a result of management measures, (ii) substantiate accuracy of such predictions, and ultimately, (iii) inform decision makers with regard to probable outcomes and consequences of distinct-management actions (Munro, 2011). In this regard, EwE affords two complementary uses: exploration and prediction (Essington, 2007). When utilised as an exploratory tool, Ecopath enables construction of heuristic models to explore scenarios of unforeseen alterations to trophic interactions that may derive from enforcement of management strategies (Essington, 2007). In exploratory applications, the focus is on discernment of prospective outcomes and uncertainties through the process of policy gaming – i.e. implementation of gaming-simulation to assist policy exploration – decision making, and strategic change (Geurts et al., 2007), wherein potential unanticipated consequences of management decisions can be determined (Walters, 1986). When utilised as a predictive tool, however, EwE may play a significant role in the actual formulation of policy decisions (e.g. de Mutsert et al., 2015; Stips et al., 2015), the focus being on the exact estimation of policy-relevant parameters such as population biomass, fishing mortality rates, and maximum sustainable yield (Essington, 2007); however, in order for Ecopath to be applied in this context, a formal assessment of the predictive capacity of the model is required.
Usefulness of any model is contingent on the reliability and accuracy of its output. Yet, as all models represent imperfect abstractions of reality, and accurate input data are seldom obtainable, the entirety of output values are de facto subject to imprecision (Loucks et al., 2005). This is particularly true of multi-species modelling approaches. As complexity of such models is augmented to reflect biological realism, a concurrent increase in scientific uncertainty due to scarce knowledge of functional relationships is unavoidable (Plagányi and Butterworth, 2004). Input-data inaccuracies and modelling uncertainties are not independent of one another and can interact in several ways, often leading to uncertainty becoming associated with model outputs (Loucks et al., 2005). The incidence of such an event can be reduced, however, through execution of, inter alia, a Sensitivity Analysis, SA (Saltelli, 2002), defined as the assessment of how variations in a model outputs can be apportioned to different sources of variations in the model inputs (Saltelli et al., 2004; Landsberg and Sands, 2011). This method is intended to quantify impact of imprecisions in input data on predicted model outputs and overall model performance (Zheng et al., 2014). As the relationship between the latter and a state variable is seldom linear, determination of sensitivity at two or more levels of parameter alteration is often required (Zheng et al., 2014). Importantly, sensitivity analysis enables discernment of ‘high-leverage’ parameters – whose values exert a significant impact on model behaviour – versus ‘low-leverage’ parameters, whose values exert a rather negligible effect on the model and its functioning (Landsberg and Sands, 2011). A vast array of approaches to analysing sensitivity are available at present; however, these can be grouped broadly into two main typologies, namely Local Sensitivity Analysis (LSA) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). LSA, also referred to as One-factor-At-a-Time (OAT), consists in the assessment of sensitivity around a sole ‘nominal point’ in the parameter space (Saltelli et al., 2008; Razavi et al., 2020), meaning that LSA assesses impact of one uncertain input parameter at a time on the model outputs. Despite its simple and intuitive nature, LSA is appropriate mostly in very specific contexts, e.g. simple models characterised by linear input-output relationships (Gupta and Razavi, 2017); however, at times, the approach has been implemented loosely in the literature, causing it to be criticised for affording a rather localised and biased picture of model sensitivities (Saltelli and Annoni, 2010; Saltelli et al., 2019). A generally more appropriate and rigorous approach is that of GSA (Saltelli et al., 2000), which investigates how uncertainty in outputs can be apportioned to uncertainty in each input parameter over their entire range (Zhou et al., 2008). GSA is useful for identifying input parameters that are key to model outputs, some approaches also quantifying the contribution of each input parameter and interactions amongst parameters to output uncertainty. The theoretically superior approaches to SA (such as GSA), however, tend to be computationally demanding and time consuming (Ye and Hill, 2017). The increasing computational expense associated with more complex models results, often, in simpler, ad hoc strategies being favoured over more rigorous approaches to SA (Gupta and Razavi, 2017), with practitioners often recommending implementation of simple methods before considering time-consuming GSA (Ye and Hill, 2017).
Despite the growing prominence that SA is achieving in the literature, EwE currently fails to include a formal assessment for parameter sensitivity, unlike earlier versions. The built-in resampling routine ‘Ecoranger’, consisting in a Monte Carlo-like approach to identify the best fitting Ecopath parameter in accordance with user-defined criteria (Christensen and Pauly, 1996), elicited extensive criticism for presenting a rather simplistic solution to faulty models, and was thus eliminated with the release of EwE version 6.0 (Christensen and Lai, 2007); however, a number of alternative routines are available within the software, enabling model users to investigate, at least partly, model performance following introduction of imprecision (Christensen and Walters, 2004). Amongst these is the built-in Monte Carlo engine, which is a random-data sampling technique that allows determination of multiple model solutions (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949), and the Ecological Indicators (ECOIND) plug-in, which is used for assessing impact of input uncertainty on a range of ecological indicators (Coll and Steenbeek, 2017).
Indicators of ecosystem status constitute a critical component of EwE outputs, as well as being integral to ecosystem-based management, playing a pivotal role in communication and in supporting objectives of conservation strategies (Rogers and Greenaway, 2005). When forecasting ecological benefits or costs of alternative marine ecosystem-management scenarios, a vast range of indicators can be of use, with several now incorporated into the EwE modelling complex (Ainsworth and Pitcher, 2006). Indicators fall into separate categories depending on their role in ecosystem monitoring, including, inter alia, (i) biodiversity, (ii) structure and functioning, (iii) stability and resistance, (iv) resource potential, and (v) anthropogenic pressure (Bundy et al., 2017). Indicators tend to be utilised collectively as part of global (Blanchard et al., 2010; Bundy et al., 2010; Coll et al., 2010), regional (Uusitalo et al., 2016), or ecosystem-level (Shackell et al., 2012) assessments of marine system status and trends, affording a detailed and, most importantly, multifaceted snapshot of ecosystem health and resilience. Consequently, the present paper focuses on output indicators describing distinct components of a given ecosystem. Considering the limitations of LSA, and the computational and time expenses associated with GSA, this paper conducts a preliminary, ad hoc assessment of the ability of Ecopath models to retrieve precisely nominal output values in the instance of imprecision being present in the inputs.

Across the scientific endeavour (and knowledge production more broadly), today's AI tools are transforming tasks like searching, synthesizing, and coding.  In recent years, the broad field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone a remarkable transformation, with rapid advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics, which have given rise to a diversity of tools and techniques (Xu et al., 2021). The AI tools  being developed are already having major impacts on the way the scientific method is conducted and are unlocking new insights across a range of scientific domains (The Royal Society, 2024; Xu et al., 2021). The emergence of generative AI models that can perform a range of tasks including gathering data, processing text, and writing software presents an array of opportunities for modern day science. Tasks that were previously performed manually by experts can now be delegated to an AI chatbot – with varying degrees of reliability – with capabilities increasing at breakneck speeds (Perrault and Clark, 2024) and with no clear limit in sight on the technical capabilities  that these systems will ultimately attain (Hughes et al., 2024).
In the field of ecology, deep learning has already been successfully integrated into well-established frameworks for undertaking correlative modelling of the abundance and distribution of species through space and time  (Lapeyrolerie et al., 2022; Tuia et al., 2022 ). Use of machine learning and other AI methods has seen slower uptake in process-based systems modelling (Karniadakis et al., 2021), which has been a growing field over recent decades. Ecosystem modelling is defined as a method that incorporates all biotic and abiotic components interacting within an ecosystem, from the smallest picophytoplankton to the largest vertebrates.   Ecosystem modelling has long been a cornerstone of ecological science , providing important insights into the complex interactions within natural systems and informing decisions in conservation, resource management, and climate change mitigation (Geary et al., 2020). This modelling approach aims to understand complex trophic and non-trophic interactions and the way in which these are shaped by environmental conditions or disrupted by human activities (Geary et al 2020 ) . Through time these models have expanded to extend into more of the human dimensions (i.e. to become social-ecological in scope).  
Given the urgency to solve increasingly complex global environmental challenges, there is a growing need for more sophisticated, accurate, and responsive modelling techniques and tools to provide guidance on how to sustainably manage social-ecological   systems. There is a parallel need for models to be more accessible, easy to use and rapidly deployable. Models can be diverse across scale, structure, and application, but are often either process-based and rooted in mathematical formulations   that aim to simulate or emulate ecological processes (DeAngelis et al., 2021), or are ‘data-driven’    and incorporate machine learning or statistical relationships to derive pattern and insights from data (Crisci et al., 2012). They may even be a mix of both – i.e. rapid statistical emulators of slow and complex process-based models  (Ni et al., 2023). Successfully building a model with enough predictive ability to be useful for environmental management and decision-making, such as setting limits on natural resource extraction or how to spatially distribute different activities and infrastructure,    requires a unique skillset that spans a combination of ecology, mathematics, and computer science (and may even extend more broadly for some models and applications e.g. socioeconomics). While there is a growing pool of skilled modellers, there are still significant bottlenecks. Even for skilled modellers, the large time investment required to either develop a novel modelling approach or apply an existing modelling framework to a new geographical context imposes a strong limit on possible applications(Holden et al., 2024b, 2024a). 
Recent and rapid advances in generative AI for a range of information processing tasks (Perrault and Clark, 2024), as well as specific domain knowledge, like medicine (Saab et al., 2024), mathematics (Trinh et al., 2024), and software development (Becker et al., 2023; Kazemitabaar et al., 2023) , present a pivotal moment in the way ecosystem modelling has been historically undertaken – with numerous opportunities for leveraging AI tools to gather, synthesize, interpret, interrogate, and analyse data and models. Whilst the prospect of applying AI to both innovating new ecosystem models and applying existing models to new contexts is exciting; it is also potentially fraught  (Agathokleous et al., 2023; Rillig et al., 2024), with the potential to mis-guide if resulting models are improperly validated, provide ‘illusions of understanding’(Messeri and Crockett, 2024), or are even deliberately mis-use d to create biased outputs and hence flawed guidance. Ecosystem modelling is a particularly interesting case study given its importance for  natural resource management decisions, which have profound effects on livelihoods and nature and which often incorporate a range of economic, social, stewardship values. As with any transformative technology in recent memory, the deep integration of AI into ecosystem modelling is likely to pose numerous challenges, including ethical     (Malakar and Lacey, 2024) legal considerations(Rodrigues, 2020). The integration of AI into ecosystem modelling is a sociotechnical endeavour that necessitates a deeper engagement with the social rules, norms, and institutions that govern these technologies (Kudina and Van De Poel, 2024 ). Currently there is a lack of clear, established protocols for developing and using AI for ecosystem modelling tools and guidelines to navigate the ethical, practical, and governance considerations of AI in ecosystem modelling. Therefore, we see a pressing need for strategic thinking and guidance on how to responsibly and effectively incorporate AI into the development and deployment of ecosystem models.    
Here we imagine how ecosystem modelling will look in a future in which the technical capabilities of AI in the ecosystem modelling space are unfettered – allowing AI to perform the role of an ecosystem modeller in supporting people’s efforts to better understand, manage, and engage with  ecological systems. We recognise that the AI systems of the future may be drastically different from the AI systems of today, and thus we aim to explore both the opportunities and risks of transferring roles and responsibilities from humans to AI, without constraining ourselves to the limitations of current AI technologies. Whilst the extent to which AI systems will develop to be capable of modelling efforts   is unknow-able, we as a community of scientists and decision-makers can use our knowledge and understanding of ecosystem modelling to articulate a vision for how AI should and should not be used, regardless of its capabilities. In this perspective, we aim to initiate a conversation on how to best incorporate AI tools into ecosystem modelling. By outlining an initial set of guiding principles and actions, we hope to support effective and responsible use of AI that,  when guided by human knowledge and values, will support more informed decisions for the sustainable and equitable management and conservation of natural resources and ecosystems. We also h ope that this prospective work will provide insights that are applicable more broadly beyond ecosystem modelling, shedding light on risks, benefits and mitigation strategies for leveraging growing AI capabilities in system modelling across disciplines.
