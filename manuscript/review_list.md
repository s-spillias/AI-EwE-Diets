  - Included ANOVA results for regional differences (F = 8279010.7, p < 0.001)
  - Added Kruskal-Wallis test results for trophic patterns (H = 164.0/172.0, p < 0.001)
  - Incorporated correlation analysis for diet matrices with confidence intervals
- [x] Make regional comparisons more systematic
  - Added coefficients of variation comparisons across regions
  - Included effect size calculations (Cohen's f = 2877.3)
  - Systematically compared mean group sizes and stability metrics
  - Added quantitative regional differences in trophic structure
- [ ] Better integrate figures and tables with text
