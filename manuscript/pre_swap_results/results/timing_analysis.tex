The computational requirements of the AI framework varied across regions. Total processing time ranged from 17.5 to 73.0 hours across regions. The most time-intensive stage was the harvesting of biological data from online databases, accounting for approximately 65\% of the total processing time. Species identification typically required 0.01 hours, while the AI-driven species grouping process averaged 0.12 hours. Diet data collection and matrix construction required 13.5 and 0.03 hours respectively, with final parameter estimation taking 0.24 hours. On average, the framework required 6.8 seconds per species for data harvesting and 3.5 seconds per species for diet data collection, though these rates varied considerably between regions due to differences in data availability and species complexity.
