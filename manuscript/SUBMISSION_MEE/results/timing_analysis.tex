The computational requirements of the AI framework varied across regions. Total processing time ranged from 2.8 to 4.8 hours across regions. The most time-intensive stage was the downloading of biological data from online databases, accounting for approximately 70\% of the total processing time. Species identification typically required 0.01 hours, while the AI-driven species grouping process averaged 0.26 hours. Diet data collection and matrix construction required 0.7 and 0.04 hours respectively, with final parameter estimation taking 0.20 hours. On average, the framework required 0.7 seconds per species for data downloading and 0.2 seconds per species for diet data collection, though these rates varied considerably between regions due to differences in data availability and species complexity.
