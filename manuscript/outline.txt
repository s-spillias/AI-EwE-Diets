# Progress Tracking

Current Status: Methods and Results complete, moving to Discussion
Next Step: Develop discussion section focusing on validation insights and regional adaptation capabilities
Last Updated: [Current Date]

Issues to Address:
1. Figure paths in results.tex need to be updated (defer to final phase)
2. Math mode markers missing in supplement.tex (defer to final phase)
3. Need to ensure all referenced files are in correct locations
4. Methods section needs to be reorganized to:
   - Present framework steps clearly
   - Detail validation approach
   - Describe study regions

Notes:
- Keep track of any decisions or changes here
- Document any challenges or questions that arise
- Note any dependencies between tasks
