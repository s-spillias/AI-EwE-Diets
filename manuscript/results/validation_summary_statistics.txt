3. Diet Matrix Reliability
------------------------

Significant Interactions Analysis (>5% of predator's diet):

Region                  Total Interactions   Unstable (>0.3)   Stability Rate
Northern Territory      358                 148               58.7% stable
South East Inshore     380                 185               51.3% stable
South East Offshore    477                 210               56.0% stable

Diet Stability Patterns:
- Most stable interactions: Detritus-based and primary producer connections
- Most variable: Predator-prey relationships in higher trophic levels
- Intermediate stability: Benthic feeding relationships

4. Statistical Analysis Results
----------------------------

Group Consistency Tests:
- Chi-square tests confirm non-random group assignments (p < 0.001 across all regions)
- Coefficients of variation for species assignments:
  * Northern Territory: 1.47-15.20%
  * South East Inshore: 0.40-24.49%
  * South East Offshore: 0.80-14.15%

Trophic Structure Analysis:
- One-way ANOVA results show significant regional differences in group characteristics
- Cohen's f effect sizes range from small (0.1-0.3) for species-level metrics to 
  large (>0.4) for group-level comparisons

Diet Matrix Reliability:
- Spearman correlations between iterations for significant interactions (>0.05):
  * Northern Territory: ρ = 0.72-0.89
  * South East Inshore: ρ = 0.68-0.85
  * South East Offshore: ρ = 0.70-0.87

Note: All statistics derived from 5 independent iterations per region.
