To evaluate the quality of diet matrices generated through artificial intelligence methods, we implemented a single-blind validation framework comparing AI-generated and expert-created Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) diet matrices across three distinct regions. Two independent domain experts were engaged to assess both matrix types without knowledge of their origin. The evaluation protocol employed a five-point Likert scale assessment, where a score of 1 indicated strong preference for the AI-generated matrix and 5 indicated strong preference for the expert-generated matrix. 

The validation framework encompassed two primary assessment criteria. First, experts evaluated the structural validity of functional group classifications within each matrix. Second, they assessed the ecological plausibility of diet proportions assigned to each functional grouping. To capture nuanced insights beyond numerical scores, experts provided qualitative feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of each matrix. This dual quantitative-qualitative approach enabled comprehensive evaluation of both methodological approaches to diet matrix construction.
