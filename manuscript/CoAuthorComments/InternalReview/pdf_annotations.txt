For example, if our dataset contains both Chrysophrys auratus (species-level) and Chrysophrys (genus-level) entries for the same organism, our algo- rithm retains only the species-level entry. Our approach processes taxonomic ranks"
  Comment: "I don't understand enough about how this exactly works but I guess there is no chance that actually this risks excluding other members of Chrysophrys that might be present but aren't specifically identified?"

This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the number of required classifications, although is vulnerable to misclassifications at higher taxonomic levels if the LLM does not have sufficient ecological capability. The success of this approach"
  Comment: "Future iterations as you suggest later in 4.4 could use additional materials to improve grouping. RAG could be useful here (I think this is stage 3) to allow provide retrieval of supplemental, species, or higher taxonomic level, specialised information."

  Comment: "I'm kind of amazed that LLMs can do this at all. That's just an observation not a criticism of this approach. Perhaps it is quite straightforward for them to provided quantitative estimates if the evidence is relatively easy to interpret this way (for example if the evidence itself includes percentage estimates). For future work, another approach here might be to ask the LLM to broadly catagorise evidence for diet sources and then tally these using a separate procedural / programmatic approach to provide a percentage estimate."

  Comment: "How unique are diet matrices? Is it common to see broad patterns in the existing literature. Would I be able to find a diet matrix or subsets thereof that are similar to the matrix here? I guess that is kind of the point, yes, there should be such sub matrix information available and the LLM intelligently composes this into an answer for this unique diet matrix?"

  Comment: "These specific variations could be very useful in searching for and providing supplementary material to improve future diet proportion estimates. Is there a lack of material in existing literature and the LLM is unable to form a reasonable conclusion? Is it that there is something unique in this ecosystem? A really interesting thing to do for future work would be to look at diet proportion error and see if this corresponds to some error in grouping. If so you might be able to ask the LLM for evidence one way or another thus gathering insight into biases or holes in the LLMs training data."
